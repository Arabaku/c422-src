I am a senior undergaduate software engineeering student at Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China. I am a key member of the Cognitive and Affective Computing Lab at my TJNU, advised by Prof. Ziping Zhao. I am also a former Baidu FE intern at DuerOS department, Baidu, Inc. My mentor is Sen Li and Yangyang Zhang, they are smart and respectful engineers.

My research at TJNU is about applied machine learning and affective computing. If you are interested, checkout my selected projects and publications at here. I also have a few creative open source application projects, like my unique personal website design.
