# Abstract
As the problem of global aging intensifies, the quality of credit for aged care service has increasingly received more attention. The traditional evaluation of credit quality of aged care service still uses the manual entry way to evaluate the service quality, which cannot well deal with huge data in the evaluation for aged care service quality. Therefore, in this paper, a credit quality evaluation system is designed and implemented to predict and evaluate user's credit ratings by a standard operation flow for aged care service. In this system, we establish a predictive model to automatically evaluate aged care service credit quality by machine learning technique. The credit data is quantified and processed for extracting credit ratings-related features. Machine learning technique is utilized to explore the latent relationship between the credit data and its rating. The credit evaluation model for aged care service can be built by supervised learning method for predicting user's credit ratings. The design and implementation of this system provides a reasonable solution for auto-evaluation of credit quality of aged care service, which can save more manpower and improve service quality in aged care service.
